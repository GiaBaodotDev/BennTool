Since I go to school by bus every day, I have to use 12000 VND bus fare for 4 trips (both going and returning). Therefore I hope you understand my decision: I have set a password for the file "BennTool_v1.0_Release" that you need to download and use. To get the password, visit the link https://stfly.me/BennToolExtractPassword
<br>After passing the capcha and reaching the place where the decompression password is stored, enter the password "BennTool@Ver1" to get the decryption password. compression.<br><br>
